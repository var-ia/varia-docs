# Analysis depth levels

The `--depth` flag controls how many analyzers run and how aggressively they parse. Applies to `analyze`, `diff`, and `explore` commands.

| Level | Analyzers | Use case |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| `brief` | Section differ only | Quick check — did anything change on this page? |
| `detailed` | Section differ, citation tracker, revert detector, template tracker | Standard analysis — most common |
| `forensic` | All analyzers including protection tracker, page move detector, category diff, wikilink diff, talk page correlation, edit cluster detection, sentence modification detection | Full audit — all 26 event types |

`brief` skips citation parsing, revert pattern matching, and template extraction. It only compares section headings between revisions.

`detailed` (default) runs the full set of deterministic analyzers. Sufficient for most workflows.

`forensic` enables cross-revision correlation (talk page matching, edit cluster detection), metadata trackers (protection changes, page moves, category and wikilink diffs), and sentence modification detection. Use when you need the complete event stream — all 26 event types — for export or visualization.

Example:

```bash
refract analyze "Earth" --depth forensic --cache
```
