# Export formats: bundles and manifests

## Signed evidence bundle (`--bundle`)

A signed evidence bundle contains all events for a page observation along with a SHA-256 hash of the complete payload. The hash lets downstream consumers verify that the data hasn't been modified since export.

```bash
wikihistory export "Earth" --bundle > earth-bundle.json
```

The bundle wraps the event array in a signed envelope:

```json
{
  "pageTitle": "Earth",
  "observationTimestamp": "2025-05-15T10:00:00Z",
  "events": [ ... ],
  "hash": "a1b2c3d4e5f6..."
}
```

Use bundles when you need an audit trail — submitting evidence to a third party, archiving for later verification, or passing events across trust boundaries.

## Replay manifest (`--manifest`)

A replay manifest is a Merkle tree of event hashes that lets you verify the exact set of events without sending the full payload. Each event's hash is a leaf in the tree; the root hash represents the complete observation.

```bash
wikihistory export "Earth" --manifest > earth-manifest.json
```

```json
{
  "pageTitle": "Earth",
  "merkleRoot": "abc...",
  "eventCount": 47,
  "leaves": [ "hash1", "hash2", ... ]
}
```

Use manifests when you need lightweight integrity verification — for example, checking whether an observation has changed without re-downloading all events. The `@refract-org/evidence-graph` package exports `createReplayManifest`, `buildMerkleTree`, `getMerkleProof`, and `verifyMerkleProof` for programmatic use.
