## Documentation principles

- **Tagline**: "Refract answers: 'What changed?'"
- **Boundary statement**: "Refract does not decide what is true. Refract makes visible how public knowledge changes."
- **Open source framing**: "What changed?" for what Refract does. "Not included: Domain-specific decision judgment." for what Refract excludes.
- **Tone**: technical, neutral, precise. No marketing language.
- **Tutorials**: markdown with TODO notes for incomplete sections.
- **CLI examples**: always use `wikihistory` as the command name.

## Copy conventions

- Use `Refract` (capital V) as the project name.
- Reference packages as `@refract-org/<name>`.
- Reference the CLI as `wikihistory`.
- Describe Refract as a deterministic observation engine.
- L1/L2/L3 references are legacy — prefer "deterministic" / "ground truth".
